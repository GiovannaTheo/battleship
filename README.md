# Battleship
Simple battleship game in Java.

Guideline:

```
  . Sort out methods() 
  . Sort out attributes for each method
  . RDD analyse and CRC cards
  . Create the class diagram
  . Create the sequence diagram (only for non-trivial parts of the game)
  . Create the stateChart diagram (only for non-trivial parts of the game)
  . Implement the code
